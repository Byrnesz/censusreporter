    <h3>Should I use American Community Survey data for this?</h3>
    <p>The IRS also provides data about <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Migration-Data">county-to-county migration</a>, based on aggregate information from individual tax returns. This data also includes information about When writing about
        this data, use caution: it does not count people who do not file tax returns, so a careless formulation might be misleading or outright wrong. However, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150221120353/http://www.urbanophile.com/2012/12/19/irs-cancels-then-uncancels-migration-data-program/">data analysis expert Aaron Renn says</a>        "This is the best source of data available, in my opinion, because it is place to place, the data set of tax returns is so large, and income data is included. This data lets you map where people are moving from and where they are moving to at
        a reasonably granular level." </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This set of tables appears very complicated, but breaks down into two major groups:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tables based on where people live now, some of whom moved in the last year</li>
        <li>Tables based on where people lived a year ago, some of whom have since moved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, geographic mobility breaks down into these groups:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Total</li>
        <li>Same house 1 year ago</li>
        <li>Moved within same county</li>
        <li>Moved from different county within same state</li>
        <li>Moved from different state</li>
        <li>Moved from abroad</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These, then are broken into (in separate tables):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Age in five-year buckets</li>
        <li>Median age</li>
        <li>Sex</li>
        <li>Race (each race is in its own table)</li>
        <li>Citizenship</li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Individual income</li>
        <li>Median income</li>
        <li>Poverty status</li>
        <li>Tenure, or length of time living at the same house</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also a small number of tables which support analysis for different kinds of mobility, such as in and out of regions, metropolitan areas, states and counties.</p>
