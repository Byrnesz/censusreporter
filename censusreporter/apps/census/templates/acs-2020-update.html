            <h2>American Community Survey</h2>
            <p>
                Census Reporter has been updated with the ACS 2016-2020 5-year data release. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As with so many other things, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the Census Bureau's operations. With the ACS, specifically, issues with survey response rates led the Bureau to cancel the normal 1-year      <span class="glossary-term">release</span>. In its place, they have released <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/experimental-data.html">"experimental" estimates</a> which are limited to data for the nation as a whole, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia. Because the format and coverage of this data release is so different from what is otherwise in Census Reporter, we are not able to adapt our site to include this data.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had previously stated that Census Reporter will only serve data from the 2020 5-year release, until the next ACS data is released. For the sake of clarity: we will no longer serve data from the 2019 5-year release. (Census Reporter has never served historical ACS releases once they are superseded.) We have retained the 2019 1-year release data, and configured our system to return that data for geographies which are not included in the 2020 5-year release. We have not actually verified that there are any such geographies, but this is the place where we can tell you how we did it, so that's how we did it.
            </p>
            <h2>2020 Decennial Census</h2>
            <p>
                Census Reporter was never designed to serve data from the Decennial Census. However, as part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/census-data-co-op">2020 Census Data Co-op</a>, we secured support to develop a new tool which summarizes the "redistricting data" from the 2020 Decennial Census for neighborhoods and other geographies that the Census Bureau doesn't support. There are no plans to integrate 2020 Decennial Census data into Census Reporter's profiles or data search tools.
